      My Chemical Romance (commonly abbreviated to MCR or My Chem) is an
      American rock band from Newark, New Jersey. The band's current lineup
      consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, lead guitarist Ray Toro, rhythm
      guitarist Frank Iero, and bassist Mikey Way. Founded by Gerard, Mikey,
      Toro, and Matt Pelissier (and later joined by Iero), the band signed with
      Eyeball Records and released their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets,
      You Brought Me Your Love, in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the
      next year and released their major-label debut, Three Cheers for Sweet
      Revenge, in 2004. Shortly after the album's release, Pelissier was
      replaced by Bob Bryar. The album was a commercial success, and it attained
      platinum status over a year later.

      The success of the band's previous albums was eclipsed by that of their
      2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which generally received favorable
      reviews from music critics and was certified triple platinum in the United
      States and the United Kingdom. The band's long-time drummer, Bob Bryar,
      left in March 2010, and they released their fourth studio album, Danger
      Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, in November of the same
      year, to positive reviews. On tour, the band replaced Bryar with drummers
      including Michael Pedicone and Jarrod Alexander, and, in 2012, added
      touring keyboardist James Dewees. Also in 2012, and the early part of
      2013, over the course of five months, the band released a series of
      singles they had recorded in 2009, under the collective title Conventional
      Weapons. Then, on March 22, 2013, one month after the release of the final
      single in the series, the band announced its breakup. In March 2014, a
      greatest hits album, titled May Death Never Stop You, was released. On
      September 23, 2016, a tenth-anniversary reissue of The Black Parade,
      including demos and live versions of the B-sides from the album and an
      early version of "Welcome to the Black Parade", titled "The Five of Us Are
      Dying", was released, titled The Black Parade/Living with Ghosts.

      In 2017, the band reunited out of the public eye. On October 31, 2019,
      they announced a reunion show, which took place in Los Angeles on December
      20, 2019. This was extended to a small tour consisting of appearances in
      Australia, New Zealand and Japan a week later. In January 2020, they
      announced North American and European tours, but these were later
      postponed to 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
